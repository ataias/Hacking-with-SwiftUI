# Lessons Learned
- UI style is hard, but SwiftUI does help a lot to make easier. In my opinion, much better than HTML and CSS.

# Next Steps
- The app does some very simple habit tracking, in the style I do in a spreadsheet. I can imagine improving it in a few ways:
  - add a "sport" mode to track workouts. It could track volume of different workouts and show a chart (this could be an app by itself I guess)
  - notifications/reminders for habits you haven't tracked in a while
  - different time frequencies for habits: allow habits to be not only daily, but one every two, three days
  - maybe photos to habits
