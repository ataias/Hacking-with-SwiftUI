* Lessons Learned

- We can use images for fills and borders, but for that we need to use ImagePaint
- If rendering is slow, we can try drawingGroup; it is not something to be used
  often, but only if you run into rendering performance problems
- The multiply blend mode is quite common and there is a shortcut modifier: colorMultiply
- SwiftUI Color.blue, .red and .green are not pure. They are blends of colors
  made to appear well in dark and light modes. For pure colors, you can
  initialize them manually: Color(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0)

* Issues
- Although I saw the tutorial with an example image that worked, I always had
  issues when running on my simulator.
