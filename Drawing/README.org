* Lessons Learned

- We can use images for fills and borders, but for that we need to use ImagePaint
- If rendering is slow, we can try drawingGroup; it is not something to be used
  often, but only if you run into rendering performance problems

* Issues
- Although I saw the tutorial with an example image that worked, I always had
  issues when running on my simulator.
