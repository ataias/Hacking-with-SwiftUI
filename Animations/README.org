* Lessons Learned
- You can animate not only views, but also bindings
- Animating bindings means to mark a state value as animated and then you can
  expect swiftui to figure out how to animate the view associated with the
  binding. You have never told the view so though.
- 3D animations can be added via explicit animations and they are quite cool
- The animation stack refers to using the "animation" modifier multiple times.
  The order they are used matters. You can have an animation for multiple other
  changes and you can even disable for part of the changes.
- Drag Gestures are simple to make and super cool
