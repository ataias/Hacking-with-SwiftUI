* Lessons Learned
- Alerts are tricky; my initial solution with a single alert and a ternary
  operator to change the button led to a non-changing alert after the first
  change from "Continue" to "Reset"
  - I changed to AlertItem, but using the same solution yielded no results
  - Afterwards I thought it could be a problem of using a method to decide
    which alert to show
  - I added some state and it was fixed
