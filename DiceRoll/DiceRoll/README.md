#  Lessons Learned
- When using CoreData, if you get a "migration failed" the cause might be that the app on the phone or simulator has an old version of the model
  - one simple solution: delete the app and install again
  - if the migration is actually necessary (app already in prod), need to figure out how to do those migrations

# For the future
- The challenge suggested haptic feedback when the dice are rolled and make sure accessibility works fine
- I used iOS 14 apis and developed only on the simulator as I don’t have iOS 14 on my device yet (don’t want to install the beta on it)
- Postponing those items
