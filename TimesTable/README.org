* Lessons Learned

- Animations are kind of cumbersome when you create a function to get the
  reference value for the animation. If you use a structure it becomes easier.
  For this project, I added the button color to the "AnswerOption" struct and it
  became much easier to make the animations
- Chaining a function to be executed after an animation can be done with a timer.
