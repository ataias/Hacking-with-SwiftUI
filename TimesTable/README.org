* Lessons Learned

- Animations are kind of cumbersome when you create a function to get the
  reference value for the animation. If you use a structure it becomes easier.
  For this project, I added the button color to the "AnswerOption" struct and it
  became much easier to make the animations
- Chaining a function to be executed after an animation can be done with a timer.

* Next Steps
- Make it more "for kids" (as in challenge on [[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/35][SwiftUI Day 35]])
- Add SRS capabilities (store statistics of answers, to make reviews more intelligent like Anki or similar program)
