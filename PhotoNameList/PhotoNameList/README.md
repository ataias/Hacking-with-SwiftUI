#  Lessons Learned

- You can check iOS device and iOS simulator data. For the device you can download it by going on the device managers (Shift + Command + 2) and for the simulator you go to the folder  `~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/`
- Once you are in the simulator folder, you can just use `rg` or `find` to find your actual folder
