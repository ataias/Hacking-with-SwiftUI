* Lessons Learned

- SwiftUI makes sure lines connect up neatly with what comes before and after.
  Because of that, you might need sometimes to draw a line in Path twice to
  make sure the borders look nice
  - an alternative is using the StrokeStyle struct

- The stroke and strokeBorder modifiers are pretty similar, but the frame of
  drawing is different. On the first, the drawing might go over the edges if
  your border is too thick, while the second frames them inside the screen
- strokeBorder can be used with views that follow the "InsettableShape" protocol
- When filling a complex shape with different overlapping paths, the even-odd
  fills can make interesting effects. To use it, you use the fill modifier with
  a style: =.fill(Color.red, style: FillStyle(eoFill: true))=
